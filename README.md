# Morse Code Converter ðŸ’» [DEVELOPMENT]
Simple Javascript based web application that can convert **Morse Code** to **Text** and vice versa. 

### PS. For now, it only supports aphabets and does not do any type of validation. 
I am looking forward to add aphanumeric support and on-type validation for punctuations and special characters, but that's still work in progress. 

The Web App is live [here](https://thatfreakcoder.github.io/morse-code-converter)
